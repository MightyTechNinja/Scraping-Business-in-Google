<h1>Scraping Business in Google</h1>
<p>This is a small script made in Python that uses Beautiful Soup and Selenium to get the name and email of companies that are on Google Maps. This data is then saved in a .csv and .xlsx document.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>All you have to do is run it and type the name of the type of companies you are looking for and the location.
For example: Martial arts companies in the United States.</p>
